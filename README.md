# Neural Network From Scratch in Python
This project aims to build and train simple feed forward neural network architectures without using any external machine learning packages such as `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, or `Theano` to name a few. Here is the list of all packages used in this project that are not included in base Python 3:
 - numpy
